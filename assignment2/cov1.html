	<h2>FACT: Hand sanitizers can be used often</h2>
	<p>An alcohol-based sanitizer does not 
	create antibiotic resistance. 
	Unlike other antiseptics and antibiotics, 
	pathogens (harmful germs) 
	do not seem to develop resistance to 
	alcohol-based sanitizers.</p></td>
    <td> <h1 id="p2">covid-19 vaccines</h1>
	<h2>About the vaccines</h2>
	<p>Equitable access to safe and effective vaccines 
	is critical to ending the COVID-19 pandemic, 
	so it is hugely encouraging to see so many 
	vaccines proving and going into development. 
	WHO is working tirelessly with partners to develop, manufacture 
	and deploy safe and effective vaccines. </p></td>
    <td> <h1 id="p2">situation reports</h1>
	<h2>Weekly Epidemiological Update</h2>
	<p>The Weekly Epidemiological Update provides an overview of 
	the global, regional and country-level 
	COVID-19 cases and deaths, highlighting key 
	data and trends; as well as other pertinent 
	epidemiological information concerning the COVID-19 pandemic.</p></td>
	<td> <h1 id="p2">global research</h1>
	<h2>Database</h2>
	<p>WHO is gathering the latest international multilingual scientific findings 
	and knowledge on COVID-19. The global 
	literature cited in the WHO COVID-19 database 
	is updated daily (Monday through Friday) from 
	searches of bibliographic databases, hand searching, 
	and the addition of other expert-referred scientific articles.</p></td>

	<h2>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)</h2>
	<p>Protect yourself and those around you:<br>
	Get vaccinated as soon as it’s your turn and follow local guidance on vaccination.<br>
	Keep physical distance of at least 1 metre from others, even if they don’t appear to be sick.<br> 
	Avoid crowds and close contact.</p></td>
    <td> <h1 id="p2">Vaccine Equity</h1>
	<h2>Let’s act together to make a difference</h2>
	<p>We can all help solve the problem of vaccine inequity. Individuals can donate 
	people-powered vaccines through GoGiveOne – you can get 
	your vaccine and give one to someone who needs it.</p></td>
    <td> <h1 id="p2">Stratergy and planning</h1>
	<h2>Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan (SPRP)</h2>
	<p>Over the past year, much has been achieved by national authorities and communities with the 
	support of WHO, donors and partners, and an unprecedented 
	effort by the scientific community and the private sector.</p></td>
	<td> <h1 id="p2">R&D blue prints and covid</h1>
	<h2>Blueprint</h2>
	<p>The current COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented, 
	but the global response draws on the lessons 
	learned from other disease outbreaks over the past several decades.</p></td>

	<h2>International Travel and Health (ITH)</h2>
	<p>Since October 2020, the WHO Guideline Development Group for 
	International Travel and Health (WHO ITH GDG) 
	is tasked with regularly evaluating the scientific 
	evidence around the effectiveness, safety and impact of 
	public health measures for reducing travel-associated 
	spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, 
	while avoiding unnecessary interference with international traffic.</p></td>

	<h2>Tracking Variants</h2>
	<p>All viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, 
	change over time. Most changes have little 
	to no impact on the virus’ properties. However, some 
	changes may affect the virus’s properties, such as how 
	easily it spreads, the associated disease severity, 
	or the performance of vaccines, therapeutic medicines, 
	diagnostic tools, or other public health and social measures.</p></td>
